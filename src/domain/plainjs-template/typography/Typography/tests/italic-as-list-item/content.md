You see, on the Internet, you’re not a person. You’re a data point. A small player in a grand A/B testing experiment of an intricate user journey.

*   _Are you browsing for flight tickets to Hawaii_?  You’re shown ads of the hotels that paid the most money for those ads - not necessarily in your best interests
*   _Are you looking to buy that new 4K tv_? Your YouTube ads are now ads of 4K televisions to help sway your decision, instead of helping you make an informed decision
*   _Are you looking to buy insurance_? Companies pay $60 per click, just be at the top when you search for ‘buy insurance’. Does the search engine serve you better or the advertiser?
