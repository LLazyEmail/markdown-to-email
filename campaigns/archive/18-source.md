IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is an open-source hypermedia communication protocol by which peer-to-peer nodes store and distribute data in a single distributed file system.

The author of this solution is the founder and head of the American start-up Protocol Labs Juan Benet. He called it "Distributed, Permanent Web” - keep in mind that a site created in IPFS can never be closed by anyone.

Okay, okay. Enough with throwing around the big words. Now, IPFS simply explained. The Internet we use has pitfalls. Of all, the information on the web is mostly centralized. That means the information is stored on servers under the control of a central company.

This, in turn, leads to further flaws. Thus, a central company that has servers becomes a single point of failure. Also, another major flaw of the centralized system is censorship. Since all data is hosted on a few main servers, the government can easily block access to them.

*In 2017, the Turkish government blocked access to the Wikipedia site because they believed it was “A National Security Threat”.*

And online space wouldn’t be completed without Wikipedia.

At the moment, the project is only at the dawn of development and is distributed mainly among open-source evangelists. But this is only the beginning.

Any technological innovation, which allows improving this or that aspect of human life, gets the deserved calling. Now we are confidently moving in the wrong direction. The cost of content and maintenance of sites will exceed the potential benefits of its use.

Large corporations are also beating the alarm, that is why a huge number of engineers are fighting to solve this problem.

An additional threat is the widespread proliferation of cheap smartphones, which give people who have never had the opportunity to access the network before. The infrastructure can't take it.
 
Alright, these were the blemishes of the centralized system. What about IPFS? Are there any benefits that can be interesting to simple users? In fact, there are some notable perks, including:

1.Users in a local network can communicate with each other, even if the Wide Area network is blocked for some reason.

2.Since no servers are required, creators can distribute their work without any cost.

3.Data loads faster as it has a higher bandwidth.

As you see, IPFS is a relatively new notion. Since most people aren’t familiar with it, it hasn’t gained much popularity. However, as the flaws of the current system are now more obvious than ever, the need for a change is definitely pressing.
