# Cybersecurity tips when working from home: Part II

Amidst the coronavirus pandemic, **[a remote work](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-protect-against-cyberthreats-while-employees-work-from-home-8n2a3t51)** situation **[has become a necessity](https://hackernoon.com/a-beginners-guide-to-personal-privacy-online-33f4dd20fc43)** with companies rolling out mandatory work-from-home policies. The digital era and **[breakthrough innovations](https://hackernoon.com/4-important-web-security-tools-during-privacy-crisis-en223wpd)** have made it utterly simple for most of us to carry out our regular **[duties from the comfort of our desk (okay, bed)](https://hackernoon.com/new-age-threats-to-your-online-privacy-and-cybersecurity-bu2t3xtq)**. But even before COVID-19 cases hit record, many people have already been **[working full-time from home](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/tech-privacy)** or local coffee shops.  So whether it’s for social distancing sake or just a standard situation, working from home is **[gaining momentum](https://hackernoon.com/cyber-threats-what-are-the-dangers-au4k3we1)**.







With that being said, this luxury (or inconvenience) comes with its downsides, mainly by way of **[online scams and security threats](https://hackernoon.com/privacy-alert-how-far-personalization-in-advertising-can-go-yrs3wmq)**. Not only can remote workers have their own **[credentials stolen](https://hackernoon.com/data-breach-wagner-campaign-leaks-names-and-emails-of-subscribers-first-cyber-error-for-b88948d46bd0)**, working from home could result in **[breaching company security](https://hackernoon.com/business-reputation-can-take-a-punch-0q19f3jcp)** too.

In part I of our series we’ve got to grips with a few **[online security tips](https://hackernoon.com/digital-consumers-its-time-to-grow-up-kw323tax)**, including **[strong password combinations](https://hackernoon.com/insiders-breach-your-organizations-data-data-tells-us-so-pyv3uao)**, business devices, and **[phish emails](https://hackernoon.com/securing-sensitive-customer-information-in-the-age-of-data-yfl3wgv)**. On that note, let us go over other **[cybersecurity recommendations](https://hackernoon.com/multiple-universities-in-united-states-suffer-data-breach-ea11f331fb04)** that will help [remote workers](https://hackernoon.com/reflecting-on-five-years-of-remote-work-at-nodesk-4o1e3t8v) keep their business, personal, and **[work data safe from hackers](https://hackernoon.com/data-breach-costs-will-get-worse-before-they-get-better-heres-why-1p44u3xib)**.








## Encrypt your emails

**[Encryption](https://hackernoon.com/end-to-end-encryption-basics-9s973yul) **is one of the fundamentals of **[online security](https://hackernoon.com/cyber-security-issues-in-2018-three-most-prominent-data-breaches-baac0b86f48)**. You can disguise your emails or messages to safeguard **[potentially sensitive information](https://hackernoon.com/security-for-pms-a-step-by-step-guide-8b1b3tgk)** from being read by anyone other than intended recipients. If you are sending personal data, contract papers, or **[company business secrets](https://hackernoon.com/top-security-penetration-testing-companies-yk103u1f)** without encrypting the content, you might as well put it on the **[notice board for public display](https://hackernoon.com/lessons-from-3-big-data-breaches-of-2017-6d2dd33305d5)**. And although encryption is seen as burdening and difficult, in reality, it is **[more straightforward than sending an email](https://hackernoon.com/phishing-my-company-an-infosec-lesson-for-businesses-ca69ab4ea906)**.








## Have a backup strategy

**[Important data can be lost](https://hackernoon.com/experts-warn-amids-budget-cuts-the-pandemic-calls-for-stepping-up-security-efforts-wc683zox)** due to a number of reasons, including **[cyber-attacks](https://hackernoon.com/facebook-forced-me-to-use-a-password-manager-16af91e2885d)**. **[Ransomware](https://hackernoon.com/the-internet-of-today-is-broken-694df3b6526a)** and other types of malware can obliterate entire systems without you knowing. That is why all important files should be **[backed up regularly](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-get-started-with-threat-modeling-before-you-get-hacked-1bf0ea3310df)**. Clearly, **[hardware backups](https://hackernoon.com/protect-your-business-from-these-7-dangerous-cyber-threats-92403tm2)** are how old-fashion guys do it, but **[cloud backup services](https://hackernoon.com/in-depth-guide-to-connecting-your-aws-and-microsoft-azure-virtual-private-networks-vpn-cb3o3wjm)** are more convenient with their backup schedule and storage options. Although skeptics still question cloud computing's value, reliability, and **[security](https://hackernoon.com/symmetric-and-asymmetric-encryption-5122f9ec65b1)**, it still remains the most viable backup option for **[business-related data](https://hackernoon.com/5-life-saving-tips-about-cyber-security-3yx3w03)**.







## Use a virtual private network (VPN)

You didn’t think we’ll skip this one? You’d be surprised, but **[VPNs value can extend beyond bypassing geographic restrictions on streaming sites](https://hackernoon.com/the-case-for-the-defence-securing-the-future-with-vpn-technology-pn1z3z4m)**. For those that are not computer savvy, a VPN implements technology that adds a **[security layer](https://hackernoon.com/information-security-tools-threats-and-trends-in-2019-2c91a57b63f8)** to private and public networks. In plain English, a VPN is your **[Invisibility Charm](https://hackernoon.com/wireguard-vpn-protocol-and-nordlynx-p21t3tw3)** that renders your data through a **[secure tunnel](https://hackernoon.com/warrant-canaries-audits-and-linux-based-protocols-shake-up-vpns-dj4w3ykb)**.

Note: A VPN comes in handy only if your devices have been checked for **[compromising malware](https://hackernoon.com/the-use-of-vpns-is-spreading-in-new-zealands-universities-z8u3ua6)**.

Also, VPNs can slow down internet speeds. So if you are planning a video conference, you need a speedy and reliable solution like **NordVPN**, for example. It comes with **security adds-on** as well.







## Patch your software regularly

Updates to device software and other apps **[are truly annoying](https://hackernoon.com/all-you-should-know-about-cybersecurity-hygiene-when-using-public-wifi-9kz3wg0)**. Especially, when you get bombarded with software products asking you to patch them. However, they **[cover critical vulnerabilities](https://hackernoon.com/owasp-top-10-net-protection-a-guide-part-1-w92r3wis)** and **[shield your systems](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-white-box-cryptography-ph143u5v)** from the updated **[threats](https://hackernoon.com/a-guide-to-enhancing-security-at-the-iot-edge-part-2-zc3o3tw7)**. Some bugs if not fixed, can leave your software **[sensitive to cyber-attacks](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-handle-every-ransomware-challenge-with-ease-using-these-tips-d1143wqo)**. At best, it may be nothing more than a minor inconvenience. At worst, it may mean your personal and business **[data being compromised](https://hackernoon.com/fintech-security-needs-to-be-taken-more-seriously-than-it-is-1q2o3zir)** or attackers taking control of your PC.

Therefore, patching your software as needed is crucial for your peace of mind. Besides, most products now come with an automatic update feature so you can leave it for the night and go to sleep.







## The Bottom Line

In Coronavirus grim reality, **[businesses rely on remote working](https://hackernoon.com/cyber-security-for-businesses-tips-to-reduce-risks-92ap3uf0)**. As cybercriminals are **[exploiting the opportunities](https://hackernoon.com/how-the-quarantine-affected-cybersecurity-new-challenges-and-solutions-fz1t3zxg)**, there is a clear spike in [phishing](https://hackernoon.com/phishing-my-company-an-infosec-lesson-for-businesses-ca69ab4ea906) and other **[criminal activity](https://hackernoon.com/analyzing-the-notpetya-malware-cloud-computing-and-cybersecurity-risks-rt3d3xco)**. Without carefully crafted IT systems, it is hard for companies to spot potential cybersecurity weaknesses in remote workspaces. Therefore, protecting the business from hacking should become a **[top priority](https://hackernoon.com/the-importance-of-cybersecurity-in-early-stage-startups-cs3z3u5v)** for newly-minted remote workers. We hope that our tips will help keep your personal and **[business data cyber-safe](https://hackernoon.com/basic-ways-ai-disrupts-our-cybersecurity-practices-6a3i3tjm)** while working outside of the office during these trying times. **[Be vigilant.
