We have a very diverse line-up of meals for this week. Kicking off the week we have a delicious flaky salmon with creamy chipotle sauce.

### Ingredients

Saffron: Gives traditional Tandoori its famous yellow coloring. This week we are using it in the marinade for the Yogurt Spiced Chicken. It can be pretty expensive, so turmeric is a good alternative, providing the same color and very comparable taste.

### Weekend Prep

Free up your evening and get a little chopping and prep work done this weekend.

Slice and Dice: Cut the vegetables and store in zippered bags or divided containers.

Make Ahead and Refrigerate: Make the sauce; Cook the noodles; Make the dressing; Make the spaetzle; Cook the rice.
